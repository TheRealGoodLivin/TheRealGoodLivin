👋 Hi, I’m Austin aka TheRealGoodLivin.

👀 I’m interested in in learning different programming languages and scripts.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about JavaScript and PowerShell since it aligns with my primary duties in the United States Space Force.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools and other items to expand my knowledge.

📫 How to reach me: austin.ml.livengood@gmail.com
